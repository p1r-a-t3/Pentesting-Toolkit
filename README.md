# Penetration Testing Resources

This repository has been forked from [Mia von Steinkirch](https://github.com/bt3gl). Since her repository has been archived and I intend to create one, I have forked her repository. It already has few resources available. I haven't got the time to go through all of them. I have put them in [bt3gl subfolder](https://github.com/p1r-a-t3/Pentesting-Toolkit/tree/master/bt3gl). My resources will be available in the parent directory of the repository. Overtime, I will merge her resources with mine and make a grand one.
